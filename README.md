ADPi
====

This repository is a playground to learn/implement the asynchronous distributed pi-calculus (ADPi) with clojure.

I am intrigued by languages that formalize distributed computation. Thus, I am using this repo to develop and experiment with implementing ADPi [1].
This code is highly experimental!
